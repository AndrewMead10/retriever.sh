# Retriever.sh - Marketing & Sales Profile

## One-Liner

**"Set up search in 5 minutes, not 5 sprints."**

---

## Target Customer Segments

| Segment | Description | Why They Buy |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Solo/Indie Hackers** | Building side projects, MVPs, or small SaaS products | Need search without burning time on infra. $5/mo is a no-brainer. |
| **Small Startups** | Early-stage teams (1-10 devs) focused on core product | Search is a "nice to have" feature, not their differentiator. Don't want to manage Vespa/Pinecone. |
| **Mid/Large Companies (Feature Teams)** | Teams inside bigger orgs adding search to a small feature | Just need something simple that works. Don't want enterprise procurement or vendor lock-in. |

**Common Thread**: Search is **not** their core product. It's a feature they want to check off the list quickly and move on.

**Use Cases**: Personal projects, internal tools, or external/customer-facing apps. Works for all three.

---

## Value Proposition

**For developers who need search but don't want to become search engineers.**

| Pain Point | How Retriever Solves It |
|------------|------------------------|
| "Pinecone/Weaviate pricing is confusing and expensive" | Flat pricing: $5, $20, or $50/mo. No surprises. |
| "I don't want to set up and manage vector DB infrastructure" | Fully managed. We handle Vespa, embeddings, scaling. |
| "I just need to add search to my app, not build a search product" | Sign up, get your API key, add 2 functions to your code. Done. |
| "I don't want to learn a new SDK or library" | No extra dependencies or libraries. Just call the endpoints. |

---

## Positioning Statement

> **Retriever.sh** is the simplest way to add search to your app.
> Sign up, get an API key, add the insert and query calls to your code.
> Flat pricing. No infrastructure. No SDKs.
> Search that just works so you can focus on what matters.

## Competitive Differentiation

| Competitor | Their Play | Retriever's Advantage |
|------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Pinecone** | Enterprise-grade vector DB | Overkill for most. Complex pricing. Retriever is simpler & cheaper. |
| **Weaviate Cloud** | Full-featured, self-hostable | Same as above. Great if search is core to your product - but for most it isn't. |
| **Algolia** | Traditional search, great UI | Expensive at scale. Not optimized for semantic/RAG. |
| **Roll your own** | pgvector + OpenAI embeddings | You're now a search engineer. Retriever handles this for you. |

**Our lane**: Developers who need "good enough" search as a feature, not a product. If search is the main part of your product, you probably need something more robust. But if it's just a feature you'd like to have - a nice-to-have along the way - this is the product for you.

## Primary Use Cases

1. **RAG for AI/Chatbots** - Give your LLM-powered app access to your docs, knowledge base, or content
2. **Internal Knowledge Search** - Company wikis, docs, runbooks - make them actually findable
3. **Documentation Search** - Help users find answers in your docs (better than Cmd+F)

---

## Key Messages

**For landing page / ads:**
- "Set up search in 5 minutes, not 5 sprints"
- "Flat pricing. No surprises. Starting at $5/mo."
- "3 API endpoints. Zero infrastructure."
- "Search is a feature, not a product. Treat it that way."

**For developer-focused content:**
- "Stop yak-shaving your search infrastructure"
- "The boring choice for search (and that's a good thing)"
- "No SDKs. No dependencies. Just HTTP."

---

## Pricing

| Plan | Price | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Tinkering** | $5/mo | For side projects and prototypes. Enough to build something real. |
| **Building** | $20/mo | For apps in production. Serious capacity, still cheap. |
| **Scale** | $50/mo | For apps with real traffic. 100 QPS, 250K vectors. |

**Key differentiator**: Flat monthly fee. No usage-based billing surprises. You know exactly what you'll pay.
